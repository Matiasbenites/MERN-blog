              Today at its special launch event, home backup power giant EcoFlow
              launched a flurry of new products, including a “Whole-Home Backup
              Power Solution.” The company also launched a battery-powered
              fridge and a portable battery-powered air-conditioning unit, which
              both makes sense. There’s also a lawn mower, which makes me think
              that preppers will have delightfully pristine lawns, even as the
              apocalypse looms.
